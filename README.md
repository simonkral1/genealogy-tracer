## Truth is a Slippery Idea

Many thinkers have problematized truth, and dogmatic claims to "truth" have often served as roadblocks for thought. Nietzsche developed a powerful response: the genealogical method. This is not a search for static facts, but a historical uncovering of the origins, contingencies, and power struggles behind the concepts we use unconsciously.

**Concept Tracer** is the operationalization of Nietzsche's genealogical method for the digital age - a browser extension that uses AI as a partner in truth-seeking, not an oracle of it.

## What It Does

Select any word or phrase on a webpage and instantly examine its intellectual history. Instead of flat definitions, Concept Tracer reveals a concept's genealogy: the story of its emergence, mutations, and the intellectual battles that have shaped it.
