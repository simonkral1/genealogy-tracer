                    <p>
                        Truth is a slippery idea. Many thinkers have problematized it, and the dogmatic claim to "truth" has often served as a roadblock for thought.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Nietzsche has criticized the traditional conception of truth deeply in his philosophy, exposing it as "a mobile army of metaphors" shaped by the will to power rather than any correspondence to reality.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        He developed a new approach to philosophical thinking: the genealogical method. This is not a search for static facts, but a historical uncovering of the origins, contingencies, and power struggles behind the concepts we use unconsciously—revealing how our cherished truths are merely interpretations that have forgotten they are interpretations.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Foucault extended this project, showing how knowledge and power are inextricably linked, how each historical period has its own "regime of truth" that determines what can be said, who can speak, and what counts as legitimate knowledge.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        His archaeological method excavates the discursive formations that make certain thoughts possible while excluding others, demonstrating that our conceptual frameworks are neither natural nor inevitable but products of specific historical configurations of power.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In an age where AI threatens to deliver "pre-cooked answers" and crystallize existing power structures into algorithmic truth, we must arm ourselves with tools for thought.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Concept Tracer is one operationalization of Nietzsche's genealogical method for the digital age - a browser extension designed to use AI as a partner in truth-seeking, not an oracle of it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Concept Tracer allows a user to highlight any word or phrase on a webpage and instantly examine its history. Instead of a flat definition, the tool reveals a concept's genealogy: a story of its emergence, its mutations, and the intellectual battles that have shaped it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It embodies Nietzsche's insight that "only that which has no history can be defined"—showing how concepts accumulate meanings through struggles, appropriations, and reinterpretations.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It shows that our most accepted truths were once radical propositions and reveals the counter-arguments embedded in their history. By unmasking the contingency of our ideas and the power relations that solidified them, it empowers users to "regularly question even accepted truths," turning passive reading into an active investigation of the genealogical weight behind our words.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Concept Tracer is more than a reference tool; it is an attempt to foster a new mode of engagement with text that resists what Foucault called "the tyranny of globalizing discourses."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It is for anyone who understands that the most important question is not "What is the truth?" but "How did this come to be seen as true?" and "What forces maintain its authority?"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        By embedding a critical historical method into our daily reading, it ensures that as AI evolves, our thinking becomes sharper, more questioning, and ultimately, more free—capable of recognizing that every concept carries within it the traces of the powers that shaped it and the possibilities for thinking otherwise.
