                        Truth is a slippery idea. Many thinkers have problematized it, and the dogmatic claim to "truth" has often served as a roadblock for thought.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Nietzsche has criticized the traditional conception of truth deeply in his philosophy, but he also developed a new approach to philosophical thinking: the genealogical method. This is not a search for static facts, but a historical uncovering of the origins, contingencies, and power struggles behind the concepts we use unconsciously.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In an age where AI threatens to deliver "pre-cooked answers" we must arm ourselves with tools for thought. Concept Tracer is one operationalization of Nietzsche's genealogical method for the digital age - a browser extension designed to use AI as a partner in truth-seeking, not an oracle of it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Concept Tracer allows a user to highlight any word or phrase on a webpage and instantly examine its history. Instead of a flat definition, the tool reveals a concept's genealogy: a story of its emergence, its mutations, and the intellectual battles that have shaped it. It shows that our most accepted truths were once radical propositions and reveals the counter-arguments embedded in their history.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        By unmasking the contingency of our ideas, it empowers users to "regularly question even accepted truths," turning passive reading into an active investigation of the genealogical weight behind our words.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Concept Tracer is more than a reference tool; it is an attempt to foster a new mode of engagement with text. It is for anyone who understands that the most important question is not "What is the truth?" but "How did this come to be seen as true?" By embedding a critical historical method into our daily reading, it ensures that as AI evolves, our thinking becomes sharper, more questioning, and ultimately, more free.
